# Final Project
The final project is an opportunity to put all of the skills you have learned together into a solo project. It is also an opportunity to dig into something you want to learn more about or gain more experience or practice with. The topic of your final project is up to you providing you meet the required specifications. The following are suggestions for projects you could consider (although you are welcome to propose something else):

- A greeting card
- An invitation
- A portfolio page
- Extend an existing non-web project to the web

## Specs
The webpage you create must:
- have a clearly defined audience;
- have a clearly defined purpose or goal;
- be a single HTML page with one external stylesheet (it is ok to create a page that would be a part of a larger site)
- meet WCAG 2.1 AA 
- demonstrate good typographic practices
- implement at least 2 layout techniques (float, positioning, flexbox, grid)
- work well across screen sizes (responsive design) 
- be live on the web
